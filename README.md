SuperBoInu – Meme Coin Experiment

Welcome to the SuperBoInu project!
This is an experimental meme coin project built on the Ethereum blockchain.
It serves as a learning resource and demonstration for smart contract and token development.

Features

ERC-20 Token: The SuperBoInu token follows the ERC-20 standard.

Staking Functionality: Users can stake their tokens to earn rewards.
